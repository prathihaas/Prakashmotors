# The 'Asli Hero'

The **New Holland 3600-2 Excel** combines the legendary reliability of the 3600 series with modern Excel advancements. It is the "Real Hero" of the 50 HP segment.

## 7-Speed Eptraa PTO
Versatility is key. The Eptraa PTO offers 7 different speeds, allowing you to save fuel on light loads or deliver maximum power to heavy threshers.

## Independent PTO Lever
The double clutch system with a separate PTO lever ensures that your implement keeps running even when you stop the tractor, preventing clogging in harvesters.

## FPT Performance
At its heart beats the FPT S8000 series engine, known globally for its ability to deliver high torque with low fuel consumption.
