# Modern Farming Defined

The **New Holland Excel 4510** brings the premium features of the Excel series to the 45 HP category. It is designed for the farmer who values technology and style.

## Excel Ergonomics
The tractor is designed around the driver. From the hanging pedals to the side-shift gears, every control is placed to minimize effort and maximize efficiency.

## Multi-Speed PTO
Like its bigger brothers, it features the 7-speed Eptraa PTO, making it incredibly versatile for running water pumps, sprayers, and rotavators economically.

## Cat-Eye Styling
The sleek new hood design isn't just for looks; it offers better visibility at night with improved headlamp positioning and aerodynamics.
