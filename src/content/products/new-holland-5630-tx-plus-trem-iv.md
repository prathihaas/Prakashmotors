# The Harvesting Beast

The **New Holland 5630 TX Plus Trem-IV** is the heavy artillery of the TX Plus series. With 75 HP, it is specifically engineered for high-load PTO applications.

## Unmatched PTO Power
This tractor is a favorite for Straw Reaper and Harvester operations because its 75 HP engine maintains PTO speed even under thick crop loads.

## Durable Drivetrain
The heavy-duty rear axle and transmission are reinforced to handle the constant vibration and load of heavy harvesting machinery.

## Advanced Emission Control
Powered by a modern CRDI engine that complies with Trem-IV norms, delivering cleaner power without sacrificing the torque needed for tough jobs.
