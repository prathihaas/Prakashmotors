# The Super Performer

The **New Holland 3230 TX Super** justifies its name by offering "Super" features in the 42 HP segment. It is built for farmers who want modern tech in a mid-sized tractor.

## Advanced Hydraulics
The Multisensing system with a DRC valve provides superior sensitivity for draft control, ensuring consistent depth during ploughing even in varying soil textures.

## Digital Monitoring
A modern digital dashboard provides real-time information on tractor performance, helping you monitor fuel levels, RPM, and service intervals accurately.

## Fuel Saving Mode
The Economy PTO mode allows you to run light implements at lower engine RPMs, saving significant amounts of diesel over time.
