# The Compact Powerhouse

The **New Holland Blue Series Simba 20** is designed specifically for specialty farming where space is limited but power is essential. It is India's first sub-20 HP tractor equipped with 4WD.

## 4WD Performance
Unlike standard small tractors, the Simba 20 comes with 4-wheel drive, providing superior traction in muddy vineyards or loose soil in cotton fields.

## Inter-Culture Expert
With its narrow track width, this machine can easily navigate between rows of cotton, sugarcane, and grapes without damaging the crops.

## Driver Comfort
Despite its small size, it features a side-shift gear lever and a comfortable platform, ensuring the operator can work long hours with minimal fatigue.
