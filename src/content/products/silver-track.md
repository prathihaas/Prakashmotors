# The Master of Wet Fields

In Telangana, paddy is often harvested when the fields are still wet. Traditional wheel harvesters fail here. Enter the **Silver Track**.

## Crawler Technology
The wide rubber tracks distribute the machine's weight over a large area, preventing it from sinking into the mud. It 'floats' over the field.

## Grain Tank
Large capacity grain tank means fewer stops for unloading, increasing your daily productivity.

## Durability
Built with high-grade steel and reinforced components to withstand the abrasive nature of paddy fields.
