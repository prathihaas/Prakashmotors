# The Versatile All-Rounder

The **New Holland Simba 30** bridges the gap between compact orchard tractors and full-sized utility machines. It offers the perfect balance of power and agility.

## Power for Puddling
With a 29 HP engine, this tractor generates enough torque to handle puddling operations in paddy fields effectively, a rarity in this size segment.

## Adjustable Track
The adjustable rim allows farmers to change the track width, making it adaptable for various crop row spacings, from maize to soybean.

## Heavy Lifting
It boasts a high lift capacity for its class, allowing it to handle heavier implements and haulage trolleys with ease.
