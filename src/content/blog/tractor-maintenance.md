# 5 Tips for Tractor Maintenance

Maintaining your New Holland tractor is essential for long-term performance, especially in the tough soil conditions of Telangana.

## 1. Daily Oil Checks
Check the engine oil level every morning before starting the tractor. Use only genuine New Holland oil for best results.

## 2. Air Filter Cleaning
Dust is the biggest enemy of your engine. Clean the air filter element every 50 hours of operation, or more frequently if working in very dusty conditions.

## 3. Coolant Level
Ensure the radiator coolant is at the recommended level. Overheating can cause severe engine damage.

## 4. Tyre Pressure
Maintain correct tyre pressure (usually 18-20 PSI for rear tyres) to ensure better grip and fuel efficiency in the field.

## 5. Grease Points
Grease all nipples, especially on the front axle and steering mechanism, every week.
