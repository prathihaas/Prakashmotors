# Harvesting Tips for Telangana Farmers

Harvesting paddy at the right time is crucial to get the maximum yield and market price.

## Moisture Content
The ideal moisture content for harvesting paddy is between **20% to 24%**. 
- If harvested too early (high moisture), drying costs increase and grains may break.
- If harvested too late (low moisture), grains may shatter during harvesting.

## Why Use Silver Track Harvester?
In Nizamabad and surrounding areas, fields often retain moisture. Wheel harvesters can get stuck. The **Silver Track Harvester** uses a crawler track system that floats on wet soil, ensuring you can harvest on time regardless of field conditions.

## Post-Harvest Care
Ensure grains are dried to 14% moisture before storage to prevent fungal attacks.
